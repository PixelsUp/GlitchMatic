## 1. Introduction

In **GlitchMatic**, players get a 2D pixel-art, roguelike game where they take control of a character trapped in a tower of glitches. The tower is riddled with broken environments, malfunctioning enemies, and an unstable reality. The character believes the solution to fix the world’s glitches lies at the top of the tower, but their own personal glitch causes them to respawn at the entrance every time they die, locking them in a loop of infinite attempts to climb to the top.

### 1.1 Brief Concept Description

The game combines elements of speedrunning and roguelike gameplay. The player races against time through glitchy environments, defeating enemies and solving puzzles to progress. Death resets them to the beginning, with each respawn offering a slightly altered experience. The game emphasizes replayability, fast reflexes, and strategic thinking.

### 1.2 Brief Story and Characters Description

- **Main Character**: A "Glitch Hunter" who enters the tower with a mission to fix the glitches that have corrupted the world. However, he is unaware of his own glitch: every time he dies, he is reset to the tower's entrance. The game’s loop revolves around this endless pursuit, with no one ever truly reaching the top.
- **Tower Entities**: Various glitch-based enemies that inhabit the tower, each with unique behaviors affected by the world’s instability.

### 1.3 Purpose, Target Audience, and Platforms

- **Purpose**: Provide an immersive roguelike experience with a unique glitch-based narrative, challenging speedrunners and casual players alike.
- **Target Audience**: Fans of roguelikes, speedrunners, and those who enjoy narrative-driven, pixel-art games like *The Binding of Isaac* and *Celeste*. The game focuses on both competitive players seeking a fast-paced experience and casual players enjoying its thematic design.
- **Platforms**: PC, potential expansion to consoles.
